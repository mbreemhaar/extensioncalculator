# An automated extension calculator for default logic

Default logic is a non-monotonic logic with default rules that extend incomplete information with plausible, but not necessarily true conclusions. The operational semantics of default logic is defined in terms of default extensions. All extensions of a default theory can be found by drawing a process tree. This project is about making an automated extension calculator using process trees for default theories.
